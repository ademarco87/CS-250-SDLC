**How Do I Interpret User Needs and Implement Them into a Program?**
    Interpreting the user needs begins with gathering detailed requirements from the stakeholders/client. This can be accomplished by interviews, surveys and simple observation. After gathering the details, analyzing those needs and priortize them based on business aspects and the impact on users. Using personas help represent different segments, ensuring diverse needs are met and addressed. Prototyping and iterative development allow for early feedback from potential users and the client alike. This ensures the final program aligns with expectations.


**How Does Creating “User Stories” Help with This?**
    User stories translate the user needs into actionable tasks for the development team. They provide clarity of features in a end-user perspective, aiding the development team in understanding what to build and the "why" behind it. User stories also facilitate prioritization, collaboration and flexability. This enables the team to adapt to changes and continously deliver a product through incremental development.


**How Do I Approach Developing Programs? What Agile Processes Do I Hope to Incorporate into My Future Development Work?**
    Approaching development with agile involes adapting principles that promote collaboration, flexability and iterative development. Using Scrum framework, I plan to utilize all aspects in the forms of sprints, daily stand-ups, sprint review(s) and retrospective. This ensures continous progress and improvements for the entire team. By implementing these concepts and testing will help maintain a high-quality product that can be delivered in a swift manner.


**What Does It Mean to Be a Good Team Member in Software Development?**
    Being a good team member in software development mean maintaining open communication, participate in any and all meetings when possible, and collaborating effectively with others. This can be sharing knowledge, open to feedback, and constructive criticism. There is no singularity of "I" in team, hence the word team: a group of people working towards a common goal. Commiting to provide a good product, taking responsibility for tasks, and demonstrating dedication to delive a high-quality product are all essential qualities.
